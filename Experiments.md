1. Lower precision increases roughness at smaller scales.
	1. Hypothesis: ![[it's_working.png]]This V-Shape comes from a polynomial (harmonic) potential, with noise caused by floating point precision. Unit of least precision of the loss / dist.
2. Replicate Tensor Programs V: wider Networks cause more roughness?
3. Compare trained params, vs random params.
4. Residual connections reduce roughness.
